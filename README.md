# Home Assistant Composite Card Library

This project collects a library of Home Assistant composite dashboard cards from community (of which a few of them are original from myself). These composite cards use the exisiting popular card such as mushroom-card, button-card, to customize including additional templating and CSS modification using HA native yaml language.
